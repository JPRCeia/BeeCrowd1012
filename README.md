Project made by Jo√£o Ramos and Theo Miguel

To run the "MavenGuide" you need to clone the repository
in the repository 
mvn install
mvn compile
mvn package
java -jar target/gs-maven-0.1.0.jar

for some misterious way the code is not compiling but running normaly, maybe some error with the mvn or java version
run mvn test and note that its run without issues

The beecrowd exercise was completed but not automated
